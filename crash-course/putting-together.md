**Back to:** [Actions](actions)

Once you and your team get the hang of it, differential diagnosis will serve as an invaluable tool
for troubleshooting complex problems. When DDx is working, everybody speaks the same language and
stays focused on the actions that will move the problem-solving effort forward.

Now that you understand the framework – symptoms, hypotheses, actions – you can start applying DDx
in your organization right away. The next time a troubleshooting effort looks like it might be
complex enough to get out of hand, remember the following steps:

1. Build a troubleshooting team with diverse perspectives.
2. Establish a cadence to go through the differential diagnosis cycle together.
3. Review symptoms, write down new hypotheses, and cross out hypotheses that no longer make sense.
4. Decide what actions will be taken next, and who will take them. Try to make sure at least one of
   these is a **test** action.
5. Repeat this cadence until the problem is solved.

It's a good idea to check out the [resources page](../resources) for some useful bits and bobs to
help your team's adoption of differential diagnosis go more smoothly. But, just like any skill,
differential diagnosis gets easier and more effective with practice. Try it out, discuss the results
with your team, and adjust your practices as you figure out what makes sense for you. And if you
learn something interesting, or have a cool story to tell about your experience with differential
diagnosis, please don't hesitate to [hit us up](../contact)!

## Example

Every day, the squad meets to go through the differential diagnosis process.

You start by reviewing the symptoms: are all the symptoms documented still relevant and accurate?
Should any new pieces of information be added to the list?

Then you talk about hypotheses. Can you rule any out based on the outcomes of recent actions? Have
any new hypotheses come to light? Is it perhaps time to break a hypothesis down into some more
specific ones?

Finally, you come to the actions. You write down the results of any actions that have been
completed, and you come up with new actions (including at least one test action!) that will move the
troubleshooting effort forward.
