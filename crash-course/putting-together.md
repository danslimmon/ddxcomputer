**Back to:** [Actions](actions)

1. Build a troubleshooting team with diverse perspectives.
2. Establish a cadence to go through the differential diagnosis cycle together.
3. Review symptoms, write down new hypotheses, and cross out hypotheses that no longer make sense.
4. Decide what actions will be taken next, and who will take them. Try to make sure at least one of
   these is a **test** action.
5. Repeat this cadence until the problem is solved.

Just like any skill, differential diagnosis gets easier and more effective with practice.
