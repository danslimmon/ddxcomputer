**Back to:** [Hypotheses](hypotheses)

The third and final phase of the differential diagnosis cycle is the Actions phase. This is where we
synthesize everything we learned in the Symptoms and Hypotheses phases into a plan.

Generally, the actions we decide to take in this phase will fall into one of two categories:

* **Tests** whose result may falsify one or more hypotheses, and
* **Research** to help the team better understand the problem space.

It's not important to categorize actions as tests or research when we're in the midst of a
troubleshooting session. But differential diagnosis works best when we make sure that there's always
at least one action in progress that can be called a test. Research tasks are great for expanding
the range of hypotheses and symptoms that can be written down, but the way we keep the
problem-solving effort moving forward is by constantly testing and ruling out hypotheses.
