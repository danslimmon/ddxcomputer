My name is [Dan Slimmon](https://danslimmon.com/resume). I've been working in Linux administration
(or DevOps, or SRE; call it what you wish) since 2007. Of late, I've been at
[Etsy](https://etsy.com) and [Hashicorp](https://hashicorp.com).  Over the years, I've applied
differential diagnosis to lots of confusing software problems on lots of different teams. Along the
way, I've refined techniques both for using DDx effectively in the moment, and for bringing this
framework into a new organization.

* [Email me](mailto:dan+ddx@danslimmon.com) any questions about differential diagnosis or about this
    website. I love to chat about this stuff!
* [Submit a PR to the website](https://github.com/danslimmon/ddxcomputer) if you have a resource to add,
    or anything you think you can help clarify
* [Follow the website](https://twitter.com/ddxcomputer) on Twitter for updates, tips, and case studies
* [Follow _me_](https://twitter.com/danslimmon) on Twitter (at your own peril: my tweets are not
    generally what one would call "professional")
