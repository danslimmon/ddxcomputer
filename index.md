**Differential diagnosis** – "DDx" for short – is a super effective strategy for investigating and
solving problems in complex systems. Differential diagnosis keeps us from falling into the most
common pitfalls of cross-role troubleshooting: information siloing, toe-stepping, and loss of
direction.

This site puts together a bunch of resources for learning about DDx and implementing it on your
team:

* **[DDx Crash Course](/crash-course/intro)**: A crash course on differential diagnosis: fundamental
    concepts, vocabulary, and how it all fits together.
* **[Sample DDx investigation](/sample-runthrough)**: A fictional account of a DDx troubleshooting
    effort, which may give you a clearer picture of how this stuff works in real life.
* **[Getting Started Guide](/getting-started)**: Advice for the practitioner who wants to bring
    differential diagnosis to their organization.
* **[Outside resources](/outside-resources)**: Links to further reading on DDx and related concepts.
* **[Me!](/about)**: I've been doing this for a long time, and I'd love to hear about how
    you use DDx in your org or discuss any challenges you've had with it.
* **[Qed](https://github.com/danslimmon/qed)**: Qed is a troubleshooting tool for distributed teams. It keeps complex investigations coherent.
